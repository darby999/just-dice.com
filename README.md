How to Bet
----------
Remember this is alpha alpha software and there should not be any more coins in your account than you are willing to lose.

The `Multiplier` box contains the number your bet will be multiplied by 
The `Steps` box contains the number of iterations the betting strategy will use until either a) a win is accomplished; or b) the number of steps is exceeded.

The chrome extension uses the `bet size` to make the initial bet.

If martingale extension will not allow you to place a bet constructed such that the Multiplier, Steps, and Bet Size would exceed your available balance.

If an input box does not have focus you are able to use the 'r' key to run the martingale strategy.

The original martingale script by darby999 is fantastic but will only bet on 1 sequence at a time (through a set amount of losses or to a win)
I had previously used grays bot before finding this one and liked the idea of starting a bot and it will continue running until you stop it or it busts.
So the need to change this one was great. I do not claim to be great with javascript and all I have learnt has been from that fantastic teacher google.

looks as of 25/10/2013
